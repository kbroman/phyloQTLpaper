[Broman KW, Kim S, Sen S, Ane C, Payseur BA (2012) Mapping quantitative trait loci onto a phylogenetic tree. Genetics 192:267-279](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745229).

The key method has been incorporated within
[R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org).

In the R code I may neglect to include `library(qtl)` because I load
that in my `.Rprofile` file.

This is still a bit incomplete.  (For example, I don't where
`R/app_results.RData` and `R/app_perms.RData` come from, nor the main
simulations results.)  I'll work to incorporate that stuff.
